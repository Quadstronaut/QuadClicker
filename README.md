# QuadClicker

The ultimate incremental clicking adventure!

## About The Project

`QuadClicker` is an addictive incremental/idle game where you click to generate resources, purchase upgrades, and build a massive automated empire. The goal is to generate as many "Quads" as possible and watch the numbers go up!

Developed by Quadstronaut (Kyle Green).

## Features

*   **Manual Clicking:** Start by clicking your way to your first upgrades.
*   **Automatic Generators:** Purchase generators that automatically produce Quads for you, even when you're not clicking.
*   **Powerful Upgrades:** Boost your clicking power and the efficiency of your generators.
*   **Tiered Progression:** Unlock new and more powerful types of generators as you progress.
*   **Prestige System:** Reset your progress to earn powerful permanent bonuses that accelerate future playthroughs.
*   **Sleek Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface to manage your growing empire.
